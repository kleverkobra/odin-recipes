        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, 
            vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients 
            are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution.
            Chinese fried rice is moist but not sticky, and has a light, loose
             and fluffy texture. This is largely because our staple rice is
              the long-grain variety.</p>
