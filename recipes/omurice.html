        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Omurice or omu-rice (オムライス, Omu-raisu) is a Japanese dish consisting of
            an omelette made with fried rice and thin, fried scrambled eggs, usually
             topped with ketchup. It is a popular dish also commonly cooked at home.
             The base of any omurice recipe starts with the fried rice, made with soft 
             scrambled eggs and rice that's flavored with ketchup and a splash of soy sauce.
